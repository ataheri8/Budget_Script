# Budget_Script

Welcome to the budget tracking script!

To start, simply download the script budget_script.py. On your command line, run python "budget_script.py" to begin

It will ask you to provide a name for the budget, your variable and non-variable expenses and your monthly income.

When you are finished, you can add entries immediately after finishing the creation or you can edit it at a later time.

A sample file of the output has been provided in the repo.
